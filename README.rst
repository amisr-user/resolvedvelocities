resolvedvelocities
==================

Overview
--------
`resolvedvelocities` is a Python implementation of the Heinselman and Nicolls Bayesian reconstruction algorithm [1]_ used to resolved 3D ion drift velocity and electric field vectors from AMISR line-of-sight measurements. There are two flavors of this algorithm, one which bins points by magnetic latitude and is typically used in the F-region to get local plasma convection velocities, and one which bins point by altitude and is typically used in the E-region to get altitude profiles of velocity.  This package contains programs to run both.

Quick Start
-----------
This package requires `numpy <https://numpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `apexpy <https://apexpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and can be installed with `pip`::

	pip install git+https://github.com/amisr/resolvedvelocities.git

This code is designed to be run from the command line with a configuration file.  The configuration file specifies the input and output file names as well as a variety of other parameters.

Latitude-Binned Resolved Velocities (Vvels-Lat)::

	resolvedvelocities-lat config.ini

Altitude-Binned Resolved Velocities (Vvels-Alt)::

	resolvedvelocities-alt config.ini


**Note**:
This package requires `numpy <https://numpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `apexpy <https://apexpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which may not install correctly automatically on some systems.  If you encounter problems installing this package, try installing both of these packages independently first following their own installation instructions before attempting to reinstall `resolvedvelocities`.
